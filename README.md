This example demonstrates a common issue in Groovy: exceptions thrown within loops and the proper handling of null values. The `myMethod` function iterates through a list of integers, throwing an exception if it encounters a zero. The solution focuses on robust error handling and null checks to prevent unexpected behavior.
